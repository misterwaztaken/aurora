# Aurora Ultimate
Aurora is a work-in-progress mod menu (GUI) that uses Orion's GUI library.
It has a lot of built-in and external scripts so far, and it is still a **work-in-progress** and is in some sort of testing stage.

**Short on time? Copy the code below and execute it in your preferred exploit of choice:**

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misterwaztaken/aurora/main/aurora-latest.lua')))()
```

This project is currently being worked on by @misterwaztaken and @spittingblood
